h1. Zed and Ginger

<pre>
    A cat runs!
    See the cat run!
    Why does the cat run?
    ...To get to the end, of course.
</pre>

A single-player game of a cat running along a corridor in a space station just for the joy of it. Based on the classic arcade/8-/16-bit game, Metro-Cross.

Created using the Ruby and the Ray gem.
