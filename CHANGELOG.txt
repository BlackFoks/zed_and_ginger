========================
     Zed and Ginger
       CHANGELOG
========================

---- v0.2.0 (2011-08-01)

  * Added full-screen toggle button in menu (runs at native resolution in full-screen).
  * Added key configuration in-game and separate key settings for each of the interplanetary felines.
  * Now, by default, Zed uses WASD with <space> and Ginger uses the arrows with <enter>.
  * Reduced level loading time by over half, which stops the game freezing at start of level (thanks Fowl).
  * Added Hardcore mutator (one life per level, rather than unlimited).
  * Added Inversion mutator (space ship is upside down).
  * Added 2-player local racing mode (same screen, but zooms and then splits if you are far apart)!
  * Reduced down-time when "killed", so that someone being disabled for a little while doesn't guarantee a loss.

---- v0.1.0 (2011-07-27)

  * First public release
