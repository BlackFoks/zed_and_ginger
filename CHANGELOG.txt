========================
     Zed and Ginger
       CHANGELOG
========================

--- v0.4.0 (unreleased)

  * Added glue on the floor (prevents jumping).
  * Added hyper-speed pill (increases run-speed, but forces you to run as fast as you can).
  * Hover-board now imposes a minimum speed.
  * Added venus fly traps.
  * Added 5th level (The Garden).
  * More clearly showed keyboard shortcuts for buttons (shortcuts have always been there, but most people didn't think of using them).

--- v0.3.0 (2011-08-10)

  * Moved resolution/fullscreen controls into Settings page.
  * Added effects/music sliders in a separate Settings page.
  * Added particle system and other graphical improvements.
  * Fixed problem with gaining extra time, which also messing up animations (e.g. of green goo texture or laser movement).
  * Changed gravity to be more realistic.
  * Added intro which explains the origin of Zed.
  * Applied flea collars.
  * Added 4th level.

--- v0.2.1 (2011-08-03)

  * Changed full-screen mode to using a full-screen borderless window, since it is always run in desktop resolution (faster and cleaner switching).
  * Fixed non-standard keys (displaying as 'Key#NNN' rather than being named) not being able to be used as move keys. Thanks Mon-Ouie for report and help with fix!
  * Fixed the broken resolution +/- buttons. Thanks eigenbom for report!
  * Made level selection buttons into a radio group and added a separate [Play] button. Thanks eigenbom for suggestion.
  * Stopped the cat sprites sometimes having floating pixels near them in some resolutions.

--- v0.2.0 (2011-08-01)

  * Added full-screen toggle button in menu (runs at native resolution in full-screen).
  * Added key configuration in-game and separate key settings for each of the interplanetary felines.
  * Now, by default, Zed uses WASD with <space> and Ginger uses the arrows with <enter>.
  * Reduced level loading time by over half, which stops the game freezing at start of level (thanks Fowl).
  * Added Hardcore mutator (one life per level, rather than unlimited).
  * Added Inversion mutator (space ship is upside down).
  * Added 2-player local racing mode (same screen, but zooms and then splits if you are far apart)!
  * Reduced down-time when "killed", so that someone being disabled for a little while doesn't guarantee a loss.

--- v0.1.0 (2011-07-27)

  * First public release
